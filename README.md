# IR Project

## Introduction

In this project, we can search the keywords and have text-statistics for the PubMed XML files and Twitter JASON files by the UI of R shinyapp.

We can directly visit the URL: [http://XXXXX](http://xxxxx/) to perform the above operations or have the following step in R:

### Required software

First we need to install and load those packages:

```r
##### Load library ########
library(readr)
library(DT)
library(magrittr) 
library(ggplot2)
library(pdp)
library(shiny)
library(XML)
library(jsonlite)
library(tibble)
library(tidytext)

library(data.table)
library(dplyr) # For `filter_all` and `mutate_all`.
library(Hmisc)
library(quanteda)
library(stringr)
```

### Open ui.R and Run App

Open the ui.R, the R script of the UI is as follows:

```r
##### UI ########
ui = tagList(
  # https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57037758/r-shiny-how-to-color-margin-of-title-panel
  titlePanel(h1("IR Project 1",
                style='background-color:#ece4db;  
                     color:#474973;
                     font-weight: 500;
                     font-family: Magneto;
                     line-height: 1.2;
                     padding-left: 15px')), 
  fluidPage(
  sidebarLayout(
    position = "right",
    sidebarPanel(
      fileInput("file1", "Choose XML Files", accept = ".xml", multiple = T),
      fileInput("file2", "Choose JSON File", accept = ".json", multiple = T),
      textInput("word_select", label = "Word to search","covid")
    ),
    mainPanel(
      tableOutput("SumTable"),
      plotOutput("HisFig"))
  ),
  fluidRow(
    dataTableOutput("table")
  )
)
)
```

After pressing the Run App button, we can see the following screen:

After Loading the XML files or JSON files, the text-statistics result(such as number of characters, number of words, number of sentences(EOS), etc.) are shown as following, we can also search the words that we are interested by the search box.

*Note: Only one file format can be entered at a time, and the page needs to be refreshed before importing files in different formats*
